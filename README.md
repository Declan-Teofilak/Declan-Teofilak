Howdy, I'm Declan Teofilak. I hold a B.S in computer science from West Chester University.

I work as software developer and analyst for one of the hottest companies in the nuclear sector, and am wrapping up the last semester of classes for my undergraduate degree in computer science.

I have a strong interest in AI, big data, and cloud infrastructure.
